sml-ev - kqueue (*BSD) and epoll (Linux) library for Standard ML (MLton and Poly/ML).

Execute "make poly" or "make mlton" command to build "t.sml" test.
Firstly, you need to edit "t-poly.sml" or "t-mlton.mlb" for Linux: replace kqueue on epoll.
Before running a test you should launch simple tcp servers on 8081 and 8082 ports, for example:
echo pong | nc -l 8081 (*BSD) or echo pong | nc -l -p 8081 (Linux)
