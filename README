sml-ev - kqueue (*BSD) and epoll (Linux) library for Standard ML (MLton and Poly/ML).

 ev-{kqueue,epoll}-{poly,mlton}.sml - base library
 ev-with-timer.sml                  - added evTimer* functions

Execute "make poly" or "make mlton" command to build "t.sml" test.
Firstly, you need to edit "t.mlp" (Poly/ML) or "t.mlb" (MLton) for Linux: replace kqueue on epoll.

Before running a test you should launch simple tcp servers on 8081 and 8082 ports, for example:
echo pong | nc -l 8081 (*BSD) or echo pong | nc -l -p 8081 (Linux)

To build timer's test (t-timer.sml) execute "make timer-poly" or "make timer-mlton".


N.B.
About *BSD.
It works on FreeBSD 12 as it is.
Apply oldBSD.diff patch for FreeBSD 11, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
